            <li>Visualize divine light and love entering you and filling you. Bring this energy down from your head into your heart.
                Believe this energy is within yourself and then you can radiate it outward.

            <li>Visualize the diversion you want to heal. Feel the divine light and love moving outward from you to that
                person. Do this from a state of mind of total relaxation and acceptance with no doubt of the
                effectiveness. Simply allowing the divine to do it's work.

            <li>Visualize your loved one receiving love and light, filling every cell in their bodies. Visualize the
                energy bringing health, happiness, vitality and joy instantly and abundantly.
            </li>
            <img src ={Distant_Healing_4} className="instructionsIcon" alt="Distant Healing Instructions"></img>
            <li>Hold the visualizations for a brief period. Take a break to help you focus intently, avoid being
                distracted and to help you avoid diluting your intention with unwanted feelings or thoughts.
            </li>
